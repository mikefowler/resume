	<p>Fellow Adventurers,</p>

	<p>When I moved to San Francisco, I promised myself I would work at AirBNB, amongst brilliant creators, working on a valuable, beautiful product. As things go, our timelines didn’t match up and I landed elsewhere. But here I am, drawn back. The reason, I’m sure of it, is that we share a common goal: creating lasting impact, community, and joy through a product that inspires adventure and new experiences. My former coworker and friend, Ian Myers, recently joined your team, and it was then that I decided to get back in touch.</p>

	<p>My name is Mike. I’m a software engineer with equal passion for the code I write and the products I work on. I have a background in art and a keen eye for usability and product design. The past several years have afforded me valuable experience working on JavaScript applications, both client-side with Backbone, and server-side with Node.js + Express. I love writing clean, standards-compliant HTML, scalable CSS systems using Sass and Compass, and JavaScript in any form. I have experience working with MVC applications, largely Rails and .NET MVC 3.</p>

	<p>Most recently I’ve been creating a webapp that targets mobile devices. The app is built using Backbone and Marionette, and backed entirely by a Node.js + Express JSON API. The experience of developing a webapp that attempts to mimic the user experience of a native app has proven to be an invaluable lesson in client-side performance and cross-browser compatibility. I’d love to bring that experience to the team at AirBNB.</p>

	<p>Thanks so much for reading through this. Working at AirBNB with a team of such talented people, helping influence the future of a brilliant product, would be an honor for me. I really hope we get a chance to talk further.</p>
