	<p>Fellow Curators of the Beat,</p>

	<p>If I were to take a close look at my life until this point, I could, without hesitation, pin a song or album to every major event. The sad memories and the joyful ones; feelings of nostalgia and the hope of things to come. For me, music has been there through it all, artists and songwriters like close friends. I'm writing to you because I'm interested in the Senior Software Engineer (Web) position you have open in San Francisco. For me, working on a product like Spotify, one that I use every day, one that provides fuel for my work, one that provides the soundtrack to my best memories, would be an honor.</p>

	<p>My name is Mike. I’m a software engineer and insatiable learner with equal passion for the code I write and the products I work on. I have a background in art and a keen eye for usability and product design. I love working on tough design problems and seeing concepts through from ideation to the first happy user. The past several years have afforded me valuable experience working on JavaScript applications, both client-side and server-side. I write clean, standards-compliant HTML, scalable and modular CSS systems using Sass and Compass, and performant JavaScript, with or without a framework. I also have experience writing PHP, working on an Agile team, and writing unit tests for my front-end code. I would love to bring my all my skills and passions to the team at Spotify.</p>

	<p>Most recently I’ve been working on a webapp that targets mobile devices. The app is built on Backbone and consumes a RESTful API built using Express. The stylesheets are written with reusability and modularity in mind, resulting in less CSS and a smaller footprint. The experience of developing a webapp that attempts to mimic the user experience of a native app has proven to be an invaluable lesson in client-side performance and cross-browser compatibility.</p>

	<p>Thanks so much for reading through this. I would love to help influence the future of such a brilliant product. I really hope we get a chance to talk further.</p>

	<p>Mike Fowler</p>
